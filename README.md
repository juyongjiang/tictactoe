:computer: Please enter your student ID, password (initialized for the first time, after that, if you forget your password, please contact admin :cop: ), and complete \"next_move(board)\" strategy that returns x, y (the position of your next piece). In other words, your goal is to win the game :partying_face:.

:information_desk_person: **Solution Tips**:bulb::
* First of all, you need to decide if you are player 1 (1 piece) or player 2 (2 piece) on input board.
* Complete the following function to return x, y (the position of your next piece), must be integer.
* Don't place piece in the position that has been occupied (not 0), otherwise, lose the game.

For example,

```python
### Input an board (3x3 list) as function argument, 
# for example:
# board = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]], visualized as:
#  +---+---+---+
#  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
#  +---+---+---+
#  | 0 | 0 | 2 |
#  +---+---+---+
#  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
#  +---+---+---+
# 0: Empty
# 1: Piece of Play 1 
# 2: Piece of Play 2 

def next_move(board):
    import random
    while True:
        x = random.randint(0, 2)
        y = random.randint(0, 2)
        if board[x][y] == 0:
            return x, y
    return 0, 0
```
